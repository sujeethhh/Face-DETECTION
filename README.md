# Face Unlock System 🔒🖥️

A **Face Recognition-based Unlock System** that securely authenticates users by detecting and recognizing their faces. This project leverages **OpenCV** and **face-recognition** libraries to provide a seamless and secure unlocking experience.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Real-time face detection and recognition  
✅ Unlock system upon successful authentication  
✅ Multi-user support  
✅ Secure and efficient facial data storage  
✅ Logs for authentication attempts  
✅ Works with a webcam  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, dlib, face-recognition, NumPy  
- **GUI:** Tkinter (Optional for UI)  
- **Database:** SQLite (for storing facial embeddings)  

## 📌 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Face-Unlock-System.git
   cd Face-Unlock-System
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python numpy face-recognition dlib
   ```
3. Run the system:
   ```sh
   python face_unlock.py
   ```

## 📷 How It Works

1. **Register Face**: Capture and store the facial data of authorized users.  
2. **Face Detection**: The system detects a face using OpenCV.  
3. **Face Recognition**: The detected face is compared against stored embeddings.  
4. **Authentication**: If a match is found, access is granted; otherwise, it's denied.

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- Stores facial embeddings instead of raw images for privacy.
- Uses strong encryption for stored data.
- Implements a threshold to minimize false positives.

## 📖 Future Enhancements

- Add support for **deep learning models** for better accuracy.
- Integrate **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)** for extra security.
- Develop a **mobile version** for remote access.
